**Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

**Description**

This JavaScript code snippet implements the logic for a basic tic-tac-toe game. It allows players to take turns clicking on boxes to mark them with "X" or "O" and checks for a winner after each move.

**Usage** 

**Setup**: Ensure you have a set of HTML elements representing the tic-tac-toe grid. These elements should be stored in an array named boxes.

**Event Handling**: Use the provided code snippet to handle click events on the grid boxes. The code toggles between "X" and "O" marks for each click, disables the clicked box .

**Checking for a Winner**: The checkWinner() function (not provided in the snippet) should be implemented separately. This function should be called after each move to determine if a player has won the game.

**Error Handling**: Ensure that boxes is properly initialized as an array containing DOM elements representing the grid boxes. Handle cases where boxes is not an array to prevent errors.
